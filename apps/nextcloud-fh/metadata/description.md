# Nextcloud-FH

Nextcloud server, a safe home for all your data.

Remote collaboration made easy.

## Installation

Due to tipi's nature of handling the APP_DOMAIN environment variable and the way Nextcloud handles trusted domains and virtual host, it is important to install Nextcloud-FH by using either:

- Expose app on local network

or

- Expose app on the internet

You can change the apps behavior by editing `runtipi/app-data/nextcloud-fh/data/nextcloud-fh/config/config.php` afterwards
