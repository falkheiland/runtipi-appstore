# WUD-FH

Keep your containers up-to-date!

WUD (aka What's up Docker?) gets you notified when a new version of your Docker Container is available.

## Registries

To avoid being rate limited, configure Logins to the used registries.
The standard configuration supports logins for:

- Github Container Registry
- Docker Hub
- LinuxServer Container Registry

Other Registries are [supported bei WUD](https://getwud.github.io/wud/#/configuration/registries/) as well, configure them in a user_config if necessary.
